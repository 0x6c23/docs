# Stores Overview
Developers and creators can create their own branded storefronts on Metaplex (ie, yourstorefront.com) to distribute their NFTs to their community. As we mentioned before, standing up a branded storefront does require some familiarity with development (ie, forking projects from GitHub). You won't however have to write any code!

## Examples 
We've been impressed, surprised, and trying to keep up (frankly!) with all the NFTs projects the Metaplex community has been creating. To get inspired, check out our Ecosystem Page (coming soon) to see the breadth from our community. 

## Anatomy of Metaplex Branded Storefront Page 
To take you through the different aspects of a Metaplex storefront, we'll take inspiration from [Cryptokickers](https://metaplex.cryptokickers.com/#/), one of the first NFT projects to launch on Metaplex. 

### Wallet 
Uses can connect any Solana wallet using the connect Wallet in the page's top right corner. 

### Live Auctions or Drops 
Primary sales. See the NFTs that are currently available for auction or sale by the developer or creator. 

### Ended Auctions or Secondary Market 
Your community can sell their NFTs here and others from the community can buy them. 

### NFT Page 
Your community can place a bid and view the NFT's attributes. NFT attributes include: 
* Royalities 
* Storage (ie, Arweave, IPFS)
* Edition (ie, if there are multiple prints or editions of an NFT, they will see that here)
* About the creation (ie, this is also a great field for SEO!) 
* Attributes (ie, these are very important for people trying to understand rarity of an NFT) 

### Top navigation 
Creators or developers can rename the top navigation as they wish. Navigation is fully responsive and supported on web and mobile and any screen size in between. 

### All NFTs 
This is the page to view all NFTs. 

### Creators 
This is the page to view the creators behind the NFTs. 

## Tips 
### Marketing 
How will people discover your NFT collection? What will motivate them to join your community and get an NFT? 

From chatting with our community, we've heard these best practices: 
* Reach your audience using Twitter. Follow similar NFT projects. Consider free NFT giveaways to build your audienceâ€”it is the the most successful tactic we've heard to help create a following.
* Engage your audience using Twitter and Discord. Keep people actively involved on your project by sharing updates. Discord has been an especially powerful tool for building community. For a good case study of a terrific Twitter and Discord, we recommend studying [Skeleton Crew](https://twitter.com/skeletoncrewrip) 
* Prevent your community from being taken advantage of by scams. More and more scammers are trying to copy the look and feel a NFT project's website and entice unsuspecting victims to connect their wallets; the scammer's website will then empty the funds of the wallet. To prevent your community from getting burned, be clear on where and when you'll drop the link to your NFT store. Drop the link moments before your sale or auction begins as to not give scammers time to copy your site. Doing a well designed launch that prevents scammers can help protect your community and keep them interested in future NFT launches. 
* Create a secondary market by not being greedy with the pricing your NFT. Instead of making your NFTs super expensive on the primary sale, price them fairly for the primary sale and leverage Metaplex's royalty feature for secondary sales and beyond. Your community will love it because they'll get a pop on their NFT price and you'll love it as you'll make more on the resale. 
* Ideal royalty rate for resales has been anywhere from 1% to 10% with 3% and 5% being most popular. The design of royalty 10% and below enables your community to make money too on their sale. 
* Creator splits. That's right! If you have multiple creators that have been part of your NFT project, consider using the creator splits feature when setting up your royalty. This feature enables creators to share the royalty fees. Because it's a smart contract, it's immutable too, which is super cool. 
* To add more personalization to your project, consider adding a landing page, see Helium's [project](https://zodiac.helium.com/) for a great examples. As Metaplex as this point does not provide a framework for marketing landing pages, you'll have to develop this one on your own via standard web development or using website builder tools like Webflows and HubSpot.
