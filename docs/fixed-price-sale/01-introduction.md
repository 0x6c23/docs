# Introduction

Fixed-price-sale is a Solana program for brands to create a membership NFT that they can distribute to a large audience.  This NFT can be used for gating access to certain things (games, events, launches, etc.) at a future date.

NFTs will be sold for fixed price. More specifically program will mint Editions.

Also program supports gating by collection feature. So creators can gate sale with some collection and it means that only holders of pointed collection are able to purchase NFT. This feature defines two stages of sale, gated and not gated. For example there can be created a market with duration 5 hours and first 3 hours are gated so only inner circle can buy a NFT.
